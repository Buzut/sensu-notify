# sensu-notify
Sensu handler written in nodejs to get notified by mail and slack when an event occurs.

# Usage

Set the required constants in `notify.js` and place it in the `handlers` directory.
```js
// ttl sets the time before next notification for the same event
// without it, if a given check runs every 30 sec and subsequently re-generates the same event
// because the issue isn't resolved, you'd be notified every 30secâ€¦
const ttl = 7200;
const email = 'your@email.com';
const slackPath = '/services/xxx/xxx/xxx';
```

Don't forget to make it executable by sensu `chmod 744 notify.js && chown sensu:sensu notify.js`

Then declare it as a handler in `handlers.json` and make it the default handler if needed:
```json
{
    "handlers": {
        "default": {
            "type": "set",
            "handlers": ["notify"]
        },
        "notify": {
           "type": "pipe",
           "command": "/etc/sensu/handlers/notify.js"
       }
    }
}
```

Finally, set it as the default handler the checks you need alerting:
```json

"checks": {
    "server_metrics": {
        "type": "metric",
        "command": "rebootRequired.sh",
        "interval": 30,
        "handlers": ["notify"],
        "subscribers": ["default"]
    },
    "raid": {
        "command": "raid.sh",
        "interval": 86400,
        "handlers": ["notify"],
        "subscribers": ["raid"]
    }
}
```
